# 100DaysOfFullStackWeb
I am going to focus on full stack web development for an hour every day for the next 100 days.
No more than one consecutive day can be skipped.

This contains:
1. frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Vue),
2. backend/server side development and Docker (HTTP, Tomcat, Servlets/JSP, Spring Boot, JDBC, MongoDB)
3. principles that combines both of them

There are some checkpoint projects that I plan to do after learning
1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in depth
2. Bootstrap and Vue.js
3. Node.js, AJAX, and SQLite driver
4. JDBC (SQLite), Apache Tomcat, Servlets/JSP
5. MongoDB and its Node.js and Java drivers, Docker, and Spring Boot
6. Everything else (Final Project)
